# utils

This repo contains some utility Java classes that I find useful to use in other Java projects

The lib directory contains version 2.2.0 of the Manchester OWL API (a very old version) and the asm.jar supplied with RepastJ 3.1 (also very old). The OWL API is only needed for the uk.ac.macaulay.util.ontology package, which won't be useful for everyone. There is a class in that package that also requires the Pellet reasoner to compile successfully.
